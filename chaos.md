Notes on the Chaos Report
====

There are two causees for why software projects have such a dismal record for success, compared to, say, building bridges (although building bridges doesn't have such a shining record). Software projects' requirements are not frozen, and software project managers do not carefully study their failures to see how they can learn from them.

The record for IT in the United States is absolutely dismal. There are more absolute failures than successes, and it is also the case that the "successes" have become successes by large amount of cutting of requirements. The failure is general and it goes everywhere. (in 2014, the rate is slightly lesser, but it remains the case that failures predominate).

They scale histograms of time overruns, cost overruns, function deficiency to a Gaussian-ish thing, but if you note the distribution is still well-defined as fat-tailled. There are many causes imputed, but what makes incomplete requirements incomplete?

Focus groups are a glorious fount of pessimism, reeking with the sweat of despair. Why are the case studies two paragraphs each and so useless? Only useful thing is the histogram.
