Fractal Time

Not to be confused with the crazy pants 2012 stuff.

Introduction

There are areas of life where systematic and huge failures in time forecasting occur. They seem to mostly be event-based progressions which do not occur in predictable fashions. The length of revolutions and wars, the length of design processes, the length of software and other design projects.

Two significant patterns in the temporal structure of data were noted by Mandelbrot: the Noah effect, which says that sudden discontinuous changes (grand floods) can occur in a lot of temporal processes, and the Joseph effect, where temporal processes are stable for a while, but then are not.

That sounds totally obvious, a bunch of baloney, but it is important to note that noticing these processes make it impossible to say that the temporal process you're talking about can be modelled with a normally distributed random walk. There's spiffy tools that Van Ness and Mandelbrot propose to try to get ahold of this problem.

Another pattern in time noted by Mandelbrot is the patterning of noise in information. To Mandelbrot, noise was patterned like a Cantor set: errors are inevitable and do not go away with enough data, because the process by which the errors occur scale with the size of the temporal interval that you're looking at.

There is, implicitly held in many cases, an assumption of normality in the scheduling of production processes. That is, it is assumed that with some dilligent effort and enough (lots! lots more!) estimation, estimates will veer closer to the truth. But it is also admitted at the same time that errors abound which scale to the size of the temporal interval you're estimating at.

We might think of another model for the timing of design work, wars, and other processes in which these events which have lots of the properties of electrical noise happen in time and invariant to the scale of things. We would take it from Mandelbrot's cantor set construction. You couldn't find out which scale you were on specifically, and you would give up: instead, you would figure out how many doublings of time, or triplings, or what have you, you were going to go through, and try to make your predictions in a power law space instead.

Here is a power law of project sizes. Some cutoffs or wherever, gotta find a graph

Many other possible explanations for a power law. Sandpile, infinite monkeys, stuff like that. Why cantor law? Delays accumulate, gains don't. Other stuff.
