Critical Chain Project Scheduling
=====

Really, should also read book. But the book is posed as a novel.

Project schedules are in the state of naivety where people pretend that they are certain. But no thoughts about unbounded uncertainty. Averaging duration of that kind is a consequence of not being on critical path...

Mentions a Bayes net method, but actually MCMC and Bayes net assume correlation in different ways than occur in power-lawl and...

What's the focus? On the buffers which we add to project methodologies. High dependence invalidates the CLT in a very strong and very interesting way...

Other causes imputed. But in power law land, causation is very iffy: look to the structure instead. And indeed, we don't have a real sense of causation in anything except multitasking. _Why_ does work expand to fill the allotted time, except for some people? Why is there no incentive to finish a task early?

Goldratt on T50: it's nicer than T80 or T90. But T100, which is actually what a manager wants, is infinite time. But even T99 is getting pretty fucking large...

"The only important date is the project completion date." But we don't really have that as a meaningful time, either. Just go into it as a way of life. Always be working on the ICT, instead of thinking of it as delineated projects. "The only way project management is going to work is if you don't have projects..."

Early finishes are no longer wasted how?

Really needs a more critical and statistical look at how projects are completed in reality. People talk about control of power laws: D'Souza says, at least in SOC systems, that's a method rife with unintended consequences. You can't intend unintended consequences: that's the problem with life. Cracks in reality, is the best measure.
