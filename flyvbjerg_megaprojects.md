The definition of megaprojects is predicated on complexity. Because of the scale of them (the apocryphal quote allegedly by Stalin, Lenin, Mao, Trotsky: "quantity has a quality all its own"), they have a qualitatively different requirement for the project managers who should lead them.

They are getting radically bigger: exponentially bigger. You see individual projects that are larger than the economies of Guetamala and Honduras and things

The theory that they're talking about is dependent upon the "Sublime". Possible things to talk about it: criticality. The effects of megaprojects is construed to be complex in a way that is scale-invariant, but there you go... Could it be criticality?
