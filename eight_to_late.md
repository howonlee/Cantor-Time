On The Inherent Uncertainty of Project Tasks Estimates
=============

Schedules are treated as deterministic, and don't make explicit allowance for uncertainties.

Worked example of the duration of a shower. A shower has no probability weight in 0 minutes: no way to skip the damn thing, but there is a fat tail on the upper end.

The important thing is the fat tail, so you imagine a lognormal and power law distribution. Lognormal ones are more commonly thought of, because the variance is not infinite. But this may be procrustean. If you go far enough, you realize that you have no certainty that a thing may be done... It's a Humean thought

Mentions: Critical Chain, MC simulation, evidence-based scheduling. All mentioned in the Dart Art book.
